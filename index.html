      <p><b>Matrix</b> is an experimental fusion excerpt I constructed to match the scene of a character walking through
        tough terrain for countless years - this led me to call it matrix as a metaphor to resemble this character's
        journey. My inspiration was taken from an artistic short film I experienced by Kehinde Wiley called <em>in
          search of the miraculous</em>. The <em>trap beat</em> drum pattern (i.e. running hi hats/open hats and claps
        on beats 2 and 4) gives the track a driving pulse to represent the movement of my character.</p>

      <p><b>D Minor Concerto</b>: This is an unfinished Baroque Concerto in D minor, that I created as a music A Level
        composition. I used the Logic stocks instruments to create this concerto. There are three solo instruments in
        this piece: the harpsichord, flute and oboe - whilst the strings are used as an accompaniment. To improve the
        work, my intention is to use the plug-in Omnisphere as my VST's, and further to complete this piece of music, I
        will add a final Episode towards the end of the extract and then conclude the piece with the last ritornello in
        the Tonic Key.

      <p><b>Jungle Space</b> was an early house piece I created using Logic stock loops. This was a piece I made to
        challenge myself in terms of constructing an afro-house styled track that continuously engaged the listener,
        whilst using your traditional repeated house music format - this includes
        two main synth melodies; four on the floor kick drum; shakers, tambourines, congas etc. to make up the
        percussion. The use of the marimba and conga drums was to establish links of a fusion between afro beats and
        house music.</p>
