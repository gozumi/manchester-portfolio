      <p>The brief for this extract of music was to create an original soundtrack for the provided film ‘We Will be
        Martians’, which is part of the Music Tech A Level exam. This was my first time attempting to create an original
        soundtrack for a space-related film.</p>
      <p>
        My initial thoughts were that I wanted to create a story through my sound. As the film could be interpreted as a
        series of ‘outer space’ scenes with no correlation, my aim was to link the images with music and create a
        narrative. Furthermore, I set out to match most of the moving images with sounds that would be associated with
        the image e.g. the loud rumbling of a rocket ship. However, I didn’t want to give sound to each and every
        movement in the film, as that would make the piece become predictable. This decision was also made to leave the
        viewer with the freedom to imagine what sounds could have been used in the ‘empty moments’, giving the piece
        more interest and room for thought and discussion by the audience.</p>
      <p>
        I put together my story through my sound by creating motifs for specific scenes and images that reoccur in the
        film, for example, the use of the triangle when the flower seeds enter the frame. The use of the 4 note pattern
        was a strong highlight of this, as it reappears towards the end of the extract but is played through the strings
        instead of the synths heard at the start.</p>
      <p>
        As this piece is still a work in progress, I would like to adjust the levels of all the tracks further to reduce
        the distortion of the sound. Additionally, to fit the A Level brief, I will adjust some of the Logic stock
        synths and change the tracks to original synths I have created, and use some samples in the piece too - both
        original and others already created.</p>

      <p><b>Matrix</b> is an experimental fusion excerpt I constructed to match the scene of a character walking through
        tough terrain for countless years - this led me to call it matrix as a metaphor to resemble this character's
        journey. My inspiration was taken from an artistic short film I experienced by Kehinde Wiley called <em>in
          search of the miraculous</em>. The <em>trap beat</em> drum pattern (i.e. running hi hats/open hats and claps
        on beats 2 and 4) gives the track a driving pulse to represent the movement of my character.</p>

      <p><b>D Minor Concerto</b>: This is an unfinished Baroque Concerto in D minor, that I created as a music A Level
        composition. I used the Logic stocks instruments to create this concerto. There are three solo instruments in
        this piece: the harpsichord, flute and oboe - whilst the strings are used as an accompaniment. To improve the
        work, my intention is to use the plug-in Omnisphere as my VST's, and further to complete this piece of music, I
        will add a final Episode towards the end of the extract and then conclude the piece with the last ritornello in
        the Tonic Key.

      <p><b>Jungle Space</b> was an early house piece I created using Logic stock loops. This was a piece I made to
        challenge myself in terms of constructing an afro-house styled track that continuously engaged the listener,
        whilst using your traditional repeated house music format - this includes
        two main synth melodies; four on the floor kick drum; shakers, tambourines, congas etc. to make up the
        percussion. The use of the marimba and conga drums was to establish links of a fusion between afro beats and
        house music.</p>

      <p><b>Rain Sinattra</b> is a jazz extract that I was asked to produce for a scene within a short film of a
        character dancing. The brief was to create an up-tempo jazz track matching 140 bpm. The music was made only
        using 6 instruments to reflect a real life jazz band. Improvements will be implemented by using the plug-in
        Omnisphere and replacing the logic stock instruments with vst's such as London Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>
